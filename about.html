        <h1>Hello! My name is Trevor.</h1>

        <p>I grew up in Fort Worth, TX and currently live in San Francisco, CA. The first experience I ever had with anything computer-related was when my dad bought me a Super Nintendo for Christmas, which must have been back in 1994 or so. It was such a
          surprise to get, I was still very young and had no idea what it was. It spurred a lifelong love of games for me! A few years later, we were able to get a windows PC. I continued playing games, now on the internet and with others, and used
          applications like AIM and IRC to keep in contact with people. I still love playing games to this day. Some of those old Super Ninendo games are still some of the best games ever created! These days I mostly play Rocket League, Civilization, Call
          of Duty, or Axie Infinity. Maybe one day I'll have the skills to create my own. :)
        <p>One of the other things I've always loved is sports. I started playing when I was pretty young, and I started playing baseball first. I eventually started playing football and basketball as well. As a teenager, I also got into skateboarding!
          These days the closest thing I do to playing sports is playing fantasy football.
        <p>I'm very passionate about music. My mom likes to tell me that she always played really good music when she was pregnant with me and that it seemed like I was dancing. The good tunes continued after I was born, of course, and I can thank her, my
          dad, and my cousin for helping cultivate my love for music. One of the things I always wish I had done is learned to play an instrument. Maybe after I learn to code, I can take that on as a new hobby. Check out what I've been listening to
          recently at my <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/trevortxsf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> last.fm</a>!
